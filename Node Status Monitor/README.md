Node Status Monitor
===================

The Node Status Monitor uses Catchpoint's REST API to check the status of all Synthetic Test Nodes you have targeted in your test configurations. This enables you to easily
stay up to date with any status changes that might impact your monitoring.

Each time the Node Status Monitor runs, it retrieves the current status (active or inactive) for each Node. It compares this to the Node's prior status,
thereby indicating which Nodes have changed status since the previous run.

Node Status Monitor is a stand-alone program provided in three different versions based on the scripting language used:

- node.js
- python 2.7
- python (3.x)

This document summarizes the design and functionality of the Node Status Monitor. For detailed installation and usage instructions specific to each language,
see the READMEs in each subfolder:

- [python 2.7 README](https://github.com/catchpoint/Community-Scripts/blob/June2021_NodeStatusMonitor/Node%20Status%20Monitor/Python%20v2.7/README.md)

Output
------------------
Node Status Monitor outputs three files:
- new_node_data.json : Contains each Node's current status in JSON format (the status just retrieved from the REST API)
- old_node_data.json : Contains each Node's prior status in JSON format (the status that was retrieved during the previous run)
- result.json : Contains Nodes' changed status in JSON format (generated by comparing the statuses in the first two files)

***NOTE result.json will not be created during the first run since there is no old node data for comparison.
